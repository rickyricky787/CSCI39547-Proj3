# CSCI39547-Proj3
  Goal:
  To further demonstrate an understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, DOM manipulation, and handling user events
  Direction:
  For each user story, make a feature branch. Try to commit often and commit frequently on each feature branch. Make sure you are creating and assigning issues. Remember, try to have your branches named as closely to the issue it is intended to build out. Do not forget to type in “closes #” in the body of Pull Requests to close associated issues. 


  A few useful methods, properties, and events for this assignment:
 - `getElementById()`
   - `addEventListener()`
   - `getElementsByTagName()`
   - `createElement()`
   - `appendChild()`
   - `event.target`
   - `node.children`
   - `Array.from()`
   - `mousedown`
   - `mouseover`
   - `mouseup`

   Assignment:
   Based on the in-class demonstration, complete the following user stories:
   As a user, I can:
   add rows to the grid
   add columns to the grid
   remove rows from the grid
   remove columns from the grid
   select a color from a dropdown menu of colors
   click on a single cell, changing its color to the currently selected color
   fill all uncolored cells with the currently selected color
   fill all cells with the currently selected color
   clear all cells/restore all cells to their original/initial color
  BONUS: click and hold (mouseover) from a single cell (start) to a different cell (end) such that all affected/hovered-over cells from start to end change to the currently selected color
